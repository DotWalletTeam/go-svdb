# Welcome to go-svdb Project
=============

# Introduce
  go-svdb Project is a bitdb (https://bitdb.network/) Project. It implements a query service on bitcoin-sv.
  
  However, go-svdb does not copy any code from bitdb, and go-svdb is a rewritten software based on the golang.

  The purpose of the go-svdb project was that Bitdb did not meet the needs of the boquan team for the project.
  
  The go-svdb service is currently used in two of the three projects of the boquan team:
  
   + mempool mining pool: pool.mempool.com, the Chinese largest bitcoin-sv mine pool.
   + LastPurse: lastpurse.com/ddpurse.com, the world's number one WeChat bsv wallet.
   + btc/bsv blockchain browser: bsv.mempool.com.

   It also works for BTC.
   
   Because a reliable, complete go-svdb service requires more servers, the next boquan team will launch a Metanet-based query service.
